# Simple-Game

## Project Details

### Description:
The aim of this project was to have a bit of fun consolidating the knowledge that I had gained and apply it to create a game. This Capstone project allowed me to demonstrate some competence in using variables, various data types, if statements, loops and nested structures.

### Functionality:
The player can move up and down with the arrow keys. If you make it to Canada, you win. If you collide with Trump you die.
